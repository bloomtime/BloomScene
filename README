Scene graph library derived from Planetary's 2D GUI.

Can handle orientation animation and things like that.

Currently still in flux, hoping to implement things like event bubbling
for version 2.

Not really designed for 3D.

Overly basic demo at https://gist.github.com/45101e6592647e276a81

You'll need to remove OrientationNode from your source tree unless you have
https://github.com/bloomtime/CinderOrientation loaded too.
