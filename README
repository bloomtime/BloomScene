Scene graph library derived from Planetary's 2D GUI.

Can handle orientation animation and things like that.

Currently still in flux, hoping to implement things like event bubbling
for version 2.

Not really designed for 3D.

The GUI components like Slider are still quite Planetary specific. They
will need some adjustment (and samples, and texture images) to be more
generally useful.
