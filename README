Scene graph library derived from Planetary's 2D GUI.

Can handle orientation animation and things like that.

Currently still in flux, hoping to implement things like event bubbling
for version 2.  Not really designed for 3D.

Overly basic demos in the samples folder - just set the CINDER_PATH and 
it should be good to go. 

To add to a new project create a group called "Blocks" and then add the
BloomScene folder to it and remove the .git, README and samples. 

If you don't need OrientationNode just remove it from your project. If
you do need it then set your app to be Objective-C++ or it won't compile.
