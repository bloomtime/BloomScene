Scene graph library derived from Planetary's 2D GUI.

Can handle orientation animation and things like that.

Currently still in flux, hoping to implement things like event bubbling
for version 2.

Not really designed for 3D.

Overly basic demo in Samples/SpaceThing - just set the CINDER_PATH and 
it should be good to go. 

You'll need to remove OrientationNode from your source tree unless you 
have https://github.com/bloomtime/CinderOrientation loaded too. Working 
on it!
